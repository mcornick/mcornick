Hi, I'm Mark.

I'm a DevOps engineer specializing in Kubernetes, AWS, and Jenkins at a company I won't name here because I'm not speaking for the company.  (It's not a secret; feel free to ask.)

I live in Reston, Virginia, about half an hour west of Washington, DC. My time zone is US/Eastern. I speak English natively, and can read and write French and a bit of Spanish. I am male and use he/him pronouns. My last name is Cornick, not McCormick; I am unrelated to any McCormicks. My username is pronounced "em-cornick."

I am no longer on the X formerly known as Twitter (because it's a toxic waste dump) and I'm not on LinkedIn (because I don't want to be chum for recruiter sharks.)

Please don't contact me about job opportunities or to sell me anything. If I'm interested, I'll find you. If you do contact me and say something like "I was reviewing your GitHub profile", I'll know you're lying.
